                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate student currently enrolled at the University of the Cordilleras, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a major in Network and Security. As a simple yet driven individual, I thrive on challenges and continuously seek opportunities to enhance my skills, improve my lifestyle, and advance my career. I am devoted to living righteously, embracing growth through exploration, and pushing my boundaries. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for traveling, discovering new skills, and engaging in experiences that broaden my perspective. I am also a dedicated health and fitness enthusiast, believing that a strong body fuels a strong mind. With an open heart and a curious spirit, I strive to make every moment a step toward becoming the best version of myself.

                <h2>Why Did I chose IT?</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose Information Technology because of its high demand in the industry, offering a competitive yet rewarding career path. Despite its challenging nature, I thrive on learning and continuously exploring new ideas beyond a single direction. Rather than limiting myself to one specialization, I embrace the versatility of being a jack-of-all-trades, allowing me to adapt to various IT fields. With a deep passion for technology and its ever-evolving landscape, I remain committed to pursuing IT, recognizing its profound impact on our fast-paced, ever-changing world.

                <h2>Here me Out!</h2>
                <p>
                    As an individual, I face struggles that often lead me to overthink my decisions and plans in life. Like many others in their 20's, I find myself caught in cycles of procrastination, laziness, and moments of undiscipline, losing motivation along the way. There are days when I question if I am truly on the right path, wondering if the future I hope for will ever align with the actions I take today.

Building meaningful connections to other people has never been easy for me. I struggle to find people I can fully rely on, leading me to navigate life’s challenges independently. At times, I even find myself doubting if I will ever meet my soulmate who will stand by me through hardships, share in my struggles, and create lasting memories.

But despite these uncertainties, one thing remains steadfast is I trust in God’s plans for me. No matter how lost I feel, I hold onto faith, knowing that every hardship has a purpose. I continue to push forward, striving to reach my goals and to give back to those who have helped shape me into the person I am today. Through all the doubts and challenges, I choose to believe that every struggle is just a stepping stone to the life I am meant to live.
